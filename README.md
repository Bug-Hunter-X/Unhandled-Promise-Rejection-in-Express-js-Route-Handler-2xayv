# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example where an asynchronous operation might throw an error, but the error isn't properly caught and handled at the top level causing the application to silently fail.  The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations within Express.js route handlers require proper error handling to prevent application crashes and provide meaningful error messages to the user.  Failing to do so results in silent failures and makes debugging considerably harder. 

## Solution

The solution involves using a `try...catch` block in the route handler. This approach ensures that even if an error occurs within the promise chain, the route handler will catch the exception and provide appropriate feedback to the client.  This also prevents the application from crashing, maintaining its stability and providing the client with insightful error information.
